🧠 If-Else Statement (Beginner)
📘 What is an If-Else Statement?

An if-else statement helps your program make decisions.
It checks a condition — if the condition is true, it runs one block of code.
If the condition is false, it runs another block.

It’s like saying:

If it’s raining, take an umbrella.
Else, go outside without one.

🧩 Basic Syntax
if condition:
    # code to run if condition is true
else:
    # code to run if condition is false

💡 Example
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("You are too young to vote.")


Output:

You can vote!

🔁 Example with elif (Else If)

You can add more choices using elif:

marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
else:
    print("Grade: C")


Output:

Grade: B

🧠 In Simple Words

if = check something

else = do this if it’s not true

elif = check another condition
